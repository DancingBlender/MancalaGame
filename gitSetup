This should hopefully be everything you need to set up a project with our git repository

1) Import the existing repository
    From the top bar menu, choose VCS -> Get from Version Control, or, if no project is currently opened,
    click Get from Version Control on the Welcome screen.

    In the Get from Version Control dialog, specify the URL of the remote repository you want to clone.
    Our link is: https://github.com/Jamsheedy/Mancala

    Click Clone. When asked to create an IntelliJ project, select Yes and click through all
    the default settings for the project set up. At this point, you should have all the existing source
    code in your repository.

2) Sign into Git
    From the top menu bar select File -> Settings -> Version Control -> GitHub
    - Select the + in the top right to add your account.

3) Connect your local files to the repository
    From the top menu bar select VCS -> Git -> Remotes
    Add the project in as a link
        - I know this seems dumb because we already used the link to clone the project, but this is the order
        that I figured it out in


Now you should be all set, and you have the project linked to the remote repository. The rest of this doc will
discuss how to download (pull) and upload(commit) the changes made by me or you.
