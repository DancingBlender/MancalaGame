This should hopefully be everything you need to set up a project with our git repository

1) Import the existing repository
    From the top bar menu, choose VCS -> Get from Version Control, or, if no project is currently opened,
    click Get from Version Control on the Welcome screen.

    In the Get from Version Control dialog, specify the URL of the remote repository you want to clone.
    Our link is: https://github.com/Jamsheedy/Mancala

    Click Clone. When asked to create an IntelliJ project, select Yes and click through all
    the default settings for the project set up. At this point, you should have all the existing source
    code in your repository.

2) Sign into Git
    From the top menu bar select File -> Settings -> Version Control -> GitHub
    - Select the + in the top right to add your account.

3) Connect your local files to the repository
    From the top menu bar select VCS -> Git -> Remotes
    Add the project in as a link
        - I know this seems dumb because we already used the link to clone the project, but this is the order
        that I figured it out in


Now you should be all set, and you have the project linked to the remote repository. The rest of this doc will
discuss how to download (pull) and upload(push) the changes made by me or you.

    - You should see two Icons in the top right of your window next to the Git: label.
    - The Blue arrow down is update
    - The green check mark is your commit

1) Committing the changes you have made to the remote repository.

    - When you are satisfied with the changes you have made, press the green check mark to commit
    - NOTE: This will only commit the changes to your LOCAL MACHINE, we need to do one more step to commit them to
        the remote repository
    - Now from the top menu bar, select VCS -> Git -> Push
    - Select the commit(s) that you just made and push them to the repository
    - Check the commit log on the website to make sure your changes went through
